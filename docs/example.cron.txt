# This example file uses a bogus time of day for when to run dm-easy.
# That's to prevent half-installed copies from hitting popular repos
# all at the same time.
# To properly install it, select a custom time of day for each machine
# where you want to run dm-easy, ideally at random.
# Put your hour (0..23) in the "h" column (instead of 25), and the
# minute (0..59) in the "m" column (instead of 66). Your cron probably
# won't mind leading zeroes, but if in doubt, omit them.
#
# Save as /etc/cron.d/debmirror-easy and chown to root:root.
#
# If it works, log files should be created within very few minutes after
# your chosen cron time. In case of errors, cron usually reports them
# via email and syslog.
